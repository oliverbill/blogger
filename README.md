User stories:

As the Blog Administrator, I want to add new posts through a form along with their timestamp and comments, so that other people can access them and comment them through the web

As the Blog Administrator, I want to edit posts so that mistakes and new information can be added to them

As the Blog Administrator, I want to remove posts with the possibility to restore them later so that they become invisible until I restore them

As the Blog Administrator, I want to email a post right after its publishing so that another user can be alerted about it

Important Notes:

- it is mandatory to start with the unit tests
- read carefully the user stories and take you time to undestand and design the solution BEFORE start coding 
- use at most the Rails resources to facilitate the development
